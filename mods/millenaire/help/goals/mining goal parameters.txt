List of parameters usable in mining goals:

sourceblockstate (a Minecraft blockstate ('red_flower;type=blue_orchid')):
Blockstate of the source, like stone (not necessarily the block being harvest - stone gives cobblestone for example).

loot (item and number: 'bone,8'):
Blocks or items  gained when mining.
