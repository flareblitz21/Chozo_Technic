4*64;Familiarity;Lately, you are often seen in these Roman areas.
8*64;Known Face;Other Romans seem to have noticed you and they speak well of you! You don't seem to be a barbarian after all.
16*64;Regular Visitor;Xaire, $name! Nice to see you. How are things?
32*64;Fellow Civilized Man;Ah, it's good to see that others outside of the Roman Empire can be civilized like us once in a while.

2*64*64;Friend of the Village;You are part of our village $name, we trust you now!
4*64*64;Respectable Ally;Congrats $name! You have earned our respect. It's difficult for outsiders to become friends of the Roman Empire, let alone respected. But YOU, you have proven yourself worthy!

-4*64;Unpleasant Outsider;We accept traders, but not people like you. Be on guard.
-16*64;Public Enemy;It was embarrassing of the whole Roman empire to let you alive. While you continue to enjoy to live, leave the Roman lands and never return.
-64*64;Apparent Barbarian;Do you not understand us? Fine, we'll try something else: BAR BAR BAR, BAR BAR, BAR BARRRR!
